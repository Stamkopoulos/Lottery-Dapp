**Web3 Lottery App Readme**

This is a web3 application developed as a project for a university course. The app allows users to participate in a lottery for three items on the Sepolia network. In order to use the app, please ensure that you have the following prerequisites:

Metamask Extension: The Metamask browser extension must be installed in your web browser. Metamask provides a secure and convenient way to interact with Ethereum-based applications. You can install Metamask from the official website: https://metamask.io/

Metamask Account: You will need to have a Metamask account to participate in the lottery. If you already have an account, make sure you are logged in. If not, create a new account through the Metamask extension.

Select Sepolia Network: Once you have Metamask installed and logged in, make sure you have selected the Sepolia network. The Sepolia network is where the lottery contract resides and where the transactions will take place. To select the Sepolia network, click on the network dropdown in the Metamask extension and choose "Sepolia" or custom RPC.
